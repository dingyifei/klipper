msgid "Max smoothing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that the input shaper can create some smoothing in "
"parts. Automatic tuning of the input shaper performed by "
"`calibrate_shaper.py` script or `SHAPER_CALIBRATE` command tries not "
"to exacerbate the smoothing, but at the same time they try to "
"minimize the resulting vibrations. Sometimes they can make a sub-"
"optimal choice of the shaper frequency, or maybe you simply prefer to"
" have less smoothing in parts at the expense of a larger remaining "
"vibrations. In these cases, you can request to limit the maximum "
"smoothing from the input shaper."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's consider the following results from the automatic tuning:"
msgstr ""

msgid "![Resonances](img/calibrate-x.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the reported `smoothing` values are some abstract projected"
" values. These values can be used to compare different "
"configurations: the higher the value, the more smoothing a shaper "
"will create. However, these smoothing scores do not represent any "
"real measure of smoothing, because the actual smoothing depends on "
"[`max_accel`](#selecting-max-accel) and `square_corner_velocity` "
"parameters. Therefore, you should print some test prints to see how "
"much smoothing exactly a chosen configuration creates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the example above the suggested shaper parameters are not bad, but"
" what if you want to get less smoothing on the X axis? You can try to"
" limit the maximum shaper smoothing using the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"which limits the smoothing to 0.2 score. Now you can get the "
"following result:"
msgstr ""

msgid "![Resonances](img/calibrate-x-max-smoothing.png)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you compare to the previously suggested parameters, the vibrations"
" are a bit larger, but the smoothing is significantly smaller than "
"previously, allowing larger maximum acceleration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When deciding which `max_smoothing` parameter to choose, you can use "
"a trial-and-error approach. Try a few different values and see which "
"results you get. Note that the actual smoothing produced by the input"
" shaper depends, primarily, on the lowest resonance frequency of the "
"printer: the higher the frequency of the lowest resonance - the "
"smaller the smoothing. Therefore, if you request the script to find a"
" configuration of the input shaper with the unrealistically small "
"smoothing, it will be at the expense of increased ringing at the "
"lowest resonance frequencies (which are, typically, also more "
"prominently visible in prints). So, always double-check the projected"
" remaining vibrations reported by the script and make sure they are "
"not too high."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that if you chose a good `max_smoothing` value for both of your "
"axes, you can store it in the `printer.cfg` as"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then, if you [rerun](#input-shaper-re-calibration) the input shaper "
"auto-tuning using `SHAPER_CALIBRATE` Klipper command in the future, "
"it will use the stored `max_smoothing` value as a reference."
msgstr ""

msgid "Selecting max_accel"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since the input shaper can create some smoothing in parts, especially"
" at high accelerations, you will still need to choose the `max_accel`"
" value that does not create too much smoothing in the printed parts. "
"A calibration script provides an estimate for `max_accel` parameter "
"that should not create too much smoothing. Note that the `max_accel` "
"as displayed by the calibration script is only a theoretical maximum "
"at which the respective shaper is still able to work without "
"producing too much smoothing. It is by no means a recommendation to "
"set this acceleration for printing. The maximum acceleration your "
"printer is able to sustain depends on its mechanical properties and "
"the maximum torque of the used stepper motors. Therefore, it is "
"suggested to set `max_accel` in `[printer]` section that does not "
"exceed the estimated values for X and Y axes, likely with some "
"conservative safety margin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, follow [this](Resonance_Compensation.md#selecting-"
"max_accel) part of the input shaper tuning guide and print the test "
"model to choose `max_accel` parameter experimentally."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same notice applies to the input shaper [auto-"
"calibration](#input-shaper-auto-calibration) with `SHAPER_CALIBRATE` "
"command: it is still necessary to choose the right `max_accel` value "
"after the auto-calibration, and the suggested acceleration limits "
"will not be applied automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are doing a shaper re-calibration and the reported smoothing "
"for the suggested shaper configuration is almost the same as what you"
" got during the previous calibration, this step can be skipped."

"**Warning!** It is not advisable to run the shaper autocalibration "
