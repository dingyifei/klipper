"This document describes Filament Width Sensor host module. Hardware "
"used for developing this host module is based on TSL1401CL linear "
"sensor array but it can work with any sensor array that has analog "
"output. You can find designs at "
"[thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=filament%20width%20sensor)"

msgid "How does it work?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sensor generates analog output based on calculated filament width. "
"Output voltage always equals to detected filament width (Ex. 1.65v, "
"1.70v, 3.0v). Host module monitors voltage changes and adjusts "
"extrusion multiplier."

msgid ""
"Sensor readings done with 10 mm intervals by default. If necessary "
"you are free to change this setting by editing "
"***MEASUREMENT_INTERVAL_MM*** parameter in "
"**filament_width_sensor.py** file."

msgid "Commands"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**QUERY_FILAMENT_WIDTH** - Return the current measured filament width"
" as result **RESET_FILAMENT_WIDTH_SENSOR** – Clear all sensor "
"readings. Can be used after filament change. "
"**DISABLE_FILAMENT_WIDTH_SENSOR** – Turn off the filament width "
"sensor and stop using it to do flow control "
"**ENABLE_FILAMENT_WIDTH_SENSOR** - Turn on the filament width sensor "
"and start using it to do flow control"
