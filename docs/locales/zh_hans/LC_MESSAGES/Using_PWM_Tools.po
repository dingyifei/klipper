"With re-purposing the printhead's fan pwm output, you can control "
"lasers or spindles. This is useful if you use switchable print heads,"
" for example the E3D toolchanger or a DIY solution. Usually, cam-"
"tools such as LaserWeb can be configured to use `M3-M5` commands, "
"which stand for *spindle speed CW* (`M3 S[0-255]`), *spindle speed "
"CCW* (`M4 S[0-255]`) and *spindle stop* (`M5`)."

"**Warning:** When driving a laser, keep all security precautions that"
" you can think of! Diode lasers are usually inverted. This means, "
"that when the MCU restarts, the laser will be *fully on* for the time"
" it takes the MCU to start up again. For good measure, it is "
"recommended to *always* wear appropriate laser-goggles of the right "
"wavelength if the laser is powered; and to disconnect the laser when "
"it is not needed. Also, you should configure a safety timeout, so "
"that when your host or MCU encounters an error, the tool will stop."

"There is a limitation of how frequent PWM updates may occur. While "
"being very precise, a PWM update may only occur every 0.1 seconds, "
"rendering it almost useless for raster engraving. However, there "
"exists an [experimental "
"branch](https://github.com/Cirromulus/klipper/tree/laser_tool) with "
"its own tradeoffs. In long term, it is planned to add this "
"functionality to main-line klipper."
